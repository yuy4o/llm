There's a fetch function that can retrieve the content of a URL. I should use that to get the latest information from the blog. The parameters for fetch include the URL, max_length, start_index, and raw. Since the user wants the latest developments, I need to fetch the content of the blog page.\n\nFirst, I'll call the fetch function with the URL https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/. I'll set max_length to a reasonable number to get the full content, maybe 10000 characters to ensure I capture the latest updates. The start_index can be 0 as it's the first request. I don't need the raw HTML, so the raw parameter should be false. This should give me the markdown content of the blog, which I can then summarize for the user.\n</think>",

To try the latest model, feel free to visit Qwen Chat and choose “Image Generation”.\nThe key features include:\nSuperior Text Rendering: Qwen-Image excels at complex text rendering, including multi-line layouts, paragraph-level semantics, and fine-grained details. It supports both alphabetic languages (e....\n\nPAPER DISCORD\nIntroduction Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for scaling language models and enhancing their deep reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. To scale RL, the foremost prerequisite is maintaining stable and robust training dynamics. However, we observe that existing RL algorithms (such as GRPO) exhibit severe instability issues during long training and lead to irreversible model collapse, hindering further performance improvements with increased compute.\nTo enable successful RL scaling, we propose the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm....\n\nDEMO API DISCORD\nIntroduction Here we introduce the latest update of Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) via Qwen API. This update builds upon the powerful Qwen3, leveraging trillions multilingual and translation tokens to comprehensively enhance the model’s multilingual understanding and translation capabilities. By integrating reinforcement learning techniques, the model achieves significant improvements in translation accuracy and linguistic fluency.\nKey Features:\nMultilingual Support for 92 Languages: Qwen-MT enables high-quality translation across 92 major official languages and prominent dialects, covering over 95% of the global population to meet diverse cross-lingual communication needs....",

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for the latest developments of Qwen. The fetched content from the blog mentions a few new models.\n\nFirst, there's Qwen3Guard, which is a safety guardrail model. It's built on Qwen3 and focuses on safety classification for prompts and responses. That's important for ensuring responsible AI interactions.\n\nThen, Qwen-Image-Edit is introduced. It's an image editing version of Qwen-Image, allowing text editing in images. They mention using Qwen2.5-VL and VAE Encoder for both semantic and appearance editing. That sounds like a big step in image manipulation capabilities.\n\nAlso, Qwen-Image itself is a 20B model with advanced text rendering and editing. The key features include superior text rendering, multi-line layouts, and support for various languages. The demo is available via Qwen Chat.\n\nAnother update is the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning. This addresses instability in training and helps scale RL for better reasoning and problem-solving.\n\nLastly, Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) has been updated with multilingual support for 92 languages, improved translation accuracy, and fluency. This covers most global populations, which is a significant enhancement for cross-lingual communication.\n\nI need to summarize these points clearly, highlighting each new development with their key features and benefits. Make sure to mention the applications and any available demos or APIs. Keep it concise but informative.\n</think>\n\nThe latest developments in the Qwen series include several significant advancements:\n\n1. **Qwen3Guard**  \n   - A safety guardrail model built on Qwen3, specializing in **prompt/response safety classification** with risk levels and categories.  \n   - Achieves state-of-the-art results on safety benchmarks across English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks.\n\n2. **Qwen-Image-Edit**  \n   - Extends Qwen-Image's text rendering to **image editing**, enabling precise text modifications.  \n   - Combines **Qwen2.5-VL** (for semantic control) and **VAE Encoder** (for visual appearance) for dual-editing capabilities.  \n   - Demo available via [Qwen Chat](https://qwenlm.github.io/chat/).\n\n3. **Qwen-Image**  \n   - A 20B MMDiT model excelling in **complex text rendering** (multi-line layouts, paragraph semantics) and image editing.  \n   - Supports alphabetic and multilingual text rendering.\n\n4. **Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO)**  \n   - A reinforcement learning algorithm to stabilize training dynamics for large language models.  \n   - Addresses instability issues in existing RL methods (e.g., GRPO) to prevent model collapse during long training.\n\n5. **Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo)**  \n   - Enhanced multilingual translation model based on Qwen3, leveraging trillions of tokens.  \n   - Supports **92 languages** (covering 95% of the global population) with improved accuracy and fluency.  \n   - Available via [Qwen API](https://dashscope.com/api).\n\nThese updates highlight Qwen's progress in **safety, multimodal capabilities, reinforcement learning, and global language support**.
