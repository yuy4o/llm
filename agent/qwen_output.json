There's the 'fetch-fetch' function which can retrieve the content of a webpage. Since the user is asking for the latest info, using this tool makes sense. I should call fetch-fetch with the given URL. The parameters needed are the URL, max_length, start_index, and raw. The URL is provided, so I'll set that. The max_length can be set to a reasonable number to get the main content without being too long. Since the user wants an introduction, maybe 5000 characters is enough. Start_index is 0 as it's the first request. Raw should be false to get the simplified content. Let me structure the tool call accordingly.\n</think>",

To try the latest model, feel free to visit Qwen Chat and choose “Image Generation”.\nThe key features include:\nSuperior Text Rendering: Qwen-Image excels at complex text rendering, including multi-line layouts, paragraph-level semantics, and fine-grained details. It supports both alphabetic languages (e....\n\nPAPER DISCORD\nIntroduction Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for scaling language models and enhancing their deep reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. To scale RL, the foremost prerequisite is maintaining stable and robust training dynamics. However, we observe that existing RL algorithms (such as GRPO) exhibit severe instability issues during long training and lead to irreversible model collapse, hindering further performance improvements with increased compute.\nTo enable successful RL scaling, we propose the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm....\n\nDEMO API DISCORD\nIntroduction Here we introduce the latest update of Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) via Qwen API. This update builds upon the powerful Qwen3, leveraging trillions multilingual and translation tokens to comprehensively enhance the model’s multilingual understanding and translation capabilities. By integrating reinforcement learning techniques, the model achieves significant improvements in translation accuracy and linguistic fluency.\nKey Features:\nMultilingual Support for 92 Languages: Qwen-MT enables high-quality translation across 92 major official languages and prominent dialects, covering over 95% of the global population to meet diverse cross-lingual communication needs....",

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked about the latest developments of Qwen. The tool response provided content from the Qwen blog. I need to summarize the key points from that content.\n\nFirst, there's Qwen3Guard, which is a safety guardrail model. It's built on Qwen3 and focuses on safety classification for prompts and responses. Then there's Qwen-Image-Edit, an image editing model based on Qwen-Image, allowing text editing and combining visual semantic and appearance control. Qwen-Image itself is a 20B model with advanced text rendering. Also mentioned is the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning, addressing training instability. Lastly, Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) has updates with multilingual support for 92 languages and improved translation accuracy using reinforcement learning.\n\nI should structure this into clear sections, maybe bullet points for each development, highlighting the main features and improvements. Make sure to mention the key capabilities and any notable achievements like state-of-the-art performance or the number of languages supported. Keep it concise but informative, ensuring the user gets a clear overview of the latest Qwen updates.\n</think>\n\nThe latest developments in the Qwen series include several significant advancements across different domains:\n\n### 1. **Qwen3Guard**  \n   - **Purpose**: Safety guardrail model for responsible AI interactions.  \n   - **Capabilities**:  \n     - Precise safety detection for prompts and responses.  \n     - Risk level classification and moderation.  \n     - State-of-the-art performance on major safety benchmarks across English, Chinese, and multilingual environments.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Qwen-Image-Edit**  \n   - **Features**:  \n     - Extends Qwen-Image’s text rendering to **image editing** tasks.  \n     - Combines **Qwen2.5-VL** (for visual semantics) and **VAE Encoder** (for visual appearance).  \n     - Enables **semantic and appearance editing** of images.  \n   - **Base Model**: Built on the 20B-parameter Qwen-Image foundation model.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Qwen-Image**  \n   - **Key Advancements**:  \n     - **Superior text rendering**: Handles multi-line layouts, paragraph semantics, and fine-grained details.  \n     - Supports alphabetic and non-alphabetic languages.  \n   - **Use Case**: Available via Qwen Chat for image generation.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO)**  \n   - **Purpose**: Addresses instability in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models.  \n   - **Achievements**:  \n     - Enables stable, large-scale RL training.  \n     - Prevents model collapse during extended training.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo)**  \n   - **Updates**:  \n     - Leverages **trillions of multilingual tokens** from Qwen3.  \n     - Enhanced **multilingual understanding and translation** via reinforcement learning.  \n   - **Features**:  \n     - Supports **92 languages** (covering ~95% of the global population).  \n     - Improved translation accuracy and linguistic fluency.  \n\n---\n\nThese updates highlight Qwen’s focus on **safety**, **multimodal capabilities**, **language diversity**, and **reinforcement learning scalability**.
