      "Okay, the user wants a haiku about Agent Framework. Let me start by recalling what a haiku is. It's a traditional Japanese poem with three lines, syllable structure 5-7-5.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out the key aspects of Agent Framework. Agent Framework probably refers to a system or structure used in artificial intelligence or software where agents operate. Agents can be autonomous entities that perform tasks, maybe in a distributed system or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I need to capture the essence of an agent framework. Words like \"agents,\" \"autonomy,\" \"tasks,\" \"collaboration,\" \"framework,\" \"structure,\" \"system,\" \"intelligence,\" \"network,\" \"interact,\" \"dynamic,\" \"adaptive,\" \"goals,\" \"environment,\" \"rules,\" \"coordination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about nature imagery since haikus often reference nature. Maybe compare the framework to something natural. For example, a hive, a network of bees, or a forest. Or maybe something like a river flowing, which can symbolize the flow of information or tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: 5 syllables. Maybe something like \"Agents weave through code\" – that's 5 syllables. It conveys the movement and integration of agents within a system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second line: 7 syllables. Maybe something about collaboration or structure. \"Collaborative minds in silent sync\" – that's 7 syllables. It suggests the agents working together harmoniously without noise, maybe in a coordinated way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third line: 5 syllables. Something about the framework's purpose or outcome. \"Building futures, unseen.\" – 5 syllables. It implies that the framework is working towards future goals, perhaps in a way that's not immediately visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check the syllables again. \"Agents weave through code\" – Agents (2) weave (1) through (1) code (1) – total 5. Good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Collaborative minds in silent sync\" – Collaborative (5) minds (1) in (1) silent (2) sync (1). Wait, that's 5+1+1+2+1=10? Wait no, each word's syllables: Collaborative (5), minds (1), in (1), silent (2), sync (1). So 5+1+1+2+1=10. Oh no, that's too long. Need 7 syllables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me rephrase. Maybe \"Collaborative minds in sync\" – that's 5+1+1+1=8. Still too long. How about \"Minds collaborate in silent sync\"? Minds (1) collaborate (4) in (1) silent (2) sync (1) – total 1+4+1+2+1=9. Still too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative approach. Maybe focus on the framework itself. \"Framework guides agents\" – 5 syllables. Then second line: \"Through tasks, they adapt and learn\" – 7 syllables. Third line: \"Shaping tomorrow's world.\" – 5 syllables. Hmm, that might work. But maybe not as poetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think of nature. \"Like bees in a hive,\" – 4 syllables. Maybe \"Agents, like bees, weave through code\" – 7 syllables. Then second line? Maybe \"Collaborative, silent, in sync\" – 6 syllables. Not quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, original attempt had a problem with the second line's syllables. Let me try again. Maybe \"Collaborative minds, in silent sync\" – Collaborative (5) minds (1), in (1) silent (2) sync (1). That's 5+1+1+2+1=10. Still too long. Maybe \"Minds in silent sync\" – 4 syllables. Then add something else. \"Collaborative minds in sync\" – 6 syllables. Close. Maybe \"Collaborative minds, in sync\" – 6. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think of the framework as a structure. \"Framework's silent dance\" – 5 syllables. Then second line: \"Agents move, tasks aligned\" – 6 syllables. Third line: \"Building futures, unseen.\" – 5. Maybe that works. But not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think of the haiku as focusing on the interaction. First line: \"Agents weave through code\" (5). Second line: \"Silent collaboration, dynamic flow\" (7). Third line: \"Framework shapes the future.\" (5). That might work. Let me check syllables:\n",
      "\n",
      "Silent (2) collaboration (5), dynamic (3) flow (1). Wait, that's 2+5+3+1=11. No. Maybe \"Silent collaboration, dynamic flow\" – maybe split differently. \"Silent collaboration, dynamic flow\" – perhaps 7 syllables. Let me count each word: Silent (2), collaboration (5), dynamic (3), flow (1). But that's 2+5+3+1=11. Not right. Maybe \"Silent, collaborative, dynamic flow\" – 2+4+3+1=10. Still too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative second line: \"Collaborative, dynamic, silent flow\" – 7 syllables? Collaborative (5), dynamic (3), silent (2), flow (1). No, that's 5+3+2+1=11. Not working.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe \"Agents collaborate, tasks aligned\" – 6 syllables. Then add something. Maybe \"Agents collaborate, tasks aligned in sync\" – 8 syllables. Too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is tricky. Let me go back. Original idea was \"Agents weave through code\" (5), then maybe \"Collaborative minds in silent sync\" (which is 10 syllables). Need to cut down. Maybe \"Minds in silent sync\" (4). Then second line could be \"Collaborative, agents weave\" – no. Maybe \"Collaborative minds sync\" – 5 syllables. Then third line? Maybe \"Framework builds unseen.\" – 5. But not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think of the framework as a structure that allows agents to work. Maybe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Agents weave through code,  \n",
      "Framework guides their silent dance—  \n",
      "Futures built unseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check syllables:\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: Agents (2) weave (1) through (1) code (1) – 5. Good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second line: Framework (2) guides (1) their (1) silent (2) dance (1) – 2+1+1+2+1=7. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third line: Futures (2) built (1) un- (1) seen (1) – 5. Wait, \"Futures built unseen\" – 2+1+2=5? Wait, \"Futures built unseen\" – Futures (2) built (1) un- (1) seen (1)? No, \"unseen\" is one syllable. So \"Futures built unseen\" is 2+1+1=4? Wait, no. Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "Futures (2) built (1) unseen (2). Wait, \"unseen\" is two syllables: un-seen. So total 2+1+2=5. Yes. So that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the haiku would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Agents weave through code,  \n",
      "Framework guides their silent dance—  \n",
      "Futures built unseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "That seems to fit. It captures the agents moving through the code, the framework guiding them in a harmonious way (silent dance), and the result is building futures that are not immediately visible. I think this works. Let me check again the syllables:\n",
      "\n",
      "Line 1: 5. Line 2: 7. Line 3: 5. Yes. And it's poetic, with a nature metaphor in \"silent dance\" and \"futures built unseen.\" I think this is a solid haiku about Agent Framework.\n",

To scale RL, the foremost prerequisite is maintaining stable and robust training dynamics. However, we observe that existing RL algorithms (such as GRPO) exhibit severe instability issues during long training and lead to irreversible model collapse, hindering further performance improvements with increased compute.\\nTo enable successful RL scaling, we propose the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm....\\n\\nDEMO API DISCORD\\nIntroduction Here we introduce the latest update of Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) via Qwen API. This update builds upon the powerful Qwen3, leveraging trillions multilingual and translation tokens to comprehensively enhance the model’s multilingual understanding and translation capabilities. By integrating reinforcement learning techniques, the model achieves significant improvements in translation accuracy and linguistic fluency.\\nKey Features:\\nMultilingual Support for 92 Languages: Qwen-MT enables high-quality translation across 92 major official languages and prominent dialects, covering over 95% of the global population to meet diverse cross-lingual communication needs....', 'name': 'fetch-fetch', 'extra': {'function_id': '1'}}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"<think>\\nOkay, let's see. The user asked about the latest developments of Qwen. The tool response provided content from the Qwen blog. I need to summarize the key points from that content.\\n\\nFirst, there's Qwen3Guard, which is a safety guardrail model. It's built on Qwen3 and focuses on safety classification for prompts and responses. Then there's Qwen-Image-Edit, an image editing model based on Qwen-Image, allowing text editing and combining visual semantic and appearance control. Qwen-Image itself is a 20B model with advanced text rendering. Also mentioned is the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning, addressing training instability. Lastly, Qwen-MT (qwen-mt-turbo) has updates with multilingual support for 92 languages and improved translation accuracy using reinforcement learning.\\n\\nI should structure this into clear sections, maybe bullet points for each development, highlighting the main features and improvements.
